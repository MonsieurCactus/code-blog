# Proposal - One Graphic many languages

I sometimes have to draw a picture made of lines and circles and arrows.

Have to draw in [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) or [Python](http://matplotlib.org/) or [Elm](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/3.0.0/Graphics-Collage) or [TiKZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/).  It would be nice to write once and export to all these items.

This project is likely to work if I keep my shapes simple enough.
